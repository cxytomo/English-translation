二十几岁的女孩，可曾想过，十年后，你会是怎样的女子？
 
和姐姐聊天时，看到她的签名改成了“时间是把杀猪刀”，问她为何作此感慨，她发照片给我看。图片上是一个抱小孩的女人，很随便的短发，身材胖胖的，很明显的双下巴，牛仔裤紧紧地贴在肉肉的腿和鼓鼓的小腹上，浅米色的上衣极其普通，但笑容很幸福，是你走在街上随意看到一个带小孩的女人脸上都洋溢着的那种母亲的笑容。姐姐问我你还记得婷婷吗？我骇然，给姐姐发了四个字，判若两人。婷婷是姐姐的高中同学，记忆中的她高高瘦瘦的，皮肤有点黑，那时也是短发，但干净利落，青春逼人。而照片上的她足有当年两倍胖，甚至不止。姐姐又发给我一张照片，还是个女人，烫着很平庸的卷发，微胖的身材，坐在床上抱着毛绒玩具温和的笑着。不能说不美，但真的是走在人群中我不会丝毫留意的那种青春已过的女子。姐姐说，她是海鸥。我更加惊讶。姐姐大我四岁，我上初中时她上高中，但我和她的同学极为相熟。那时候觉得海鸥是姐姐身边同学中最漂亮的一个，她留着很长很长的头发，有时候会扎成两个马尾，身材纤细玲珑，穿着裙子的样子像极了美少女战士，很有灵气。多年过去，姐姐的这些同学我再没见过，只是没想到，若干年后，还未及三十岁，她们已再不是当年的模样。
 
姐姐说，这回明白我签名的含义了吧。我微笑感慨，女人的青春真短暂。又开玩笑说，怪不得现在很流行女人对小三说，谁没有年轻过。

What kind of girl will you be ten years later?
You girls who are in your twenties, have you ever think about what kind of girl you'll be ten years later?

While chatting with my sister, I notice that her status has changed. It goes, 'Time is the knife of a butcher’. I ask her why. She doesn't answer but sends me a picture. It is a woman with a baby in her arms. The woman is fat and jowly with casually short hair. Her jeans go tightly with her fleshly legs and bulging belly. Her light beige coat is a common one, but her smile, which would appear on the face of any mother, tells her happiness. 'Do you still remember Tingting?’ my sister asked. I'm shocked. How can I forget? Tingting is my sister's schoolmate in high school. In my memory, she was thin and tall with dark skin and short hair, too. But she looked cool and shiny then. Now she is twice or more fatter than she was. Sister sends me another picture. This time, it is a woman with plain curl hair, a little fat body, sitting on the bed with a plush toy in arms and smiling. You can't deny her beauty. However, it is true that she is the kind of woman who has lost her bloom and would not catch any attention in crowd. 'She is Seagull.' my sister surprises me again. My sister is four years older than me. I was in middle school when she was in high school. But I was quite familiar with her classmates. At that time, I think Seagull was the most beautiful one of my sister's friends. She kept long hair and sometimes bound it up into two. She was thin and looked pretty in dress, just like Sailor Moon. Years passed away. I didn't meet my sister's classmates any more. But beyond my expectation, they've changed so much even when they're younger than 30. 'Now you can understand the meaning of my status.' said my sister. Yes! I smiled to accept the shortness of women's youth. Now I understand why nowadays more and more women would like to say to The Third Woman that we all had youth and charm before.
