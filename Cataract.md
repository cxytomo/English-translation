# Cataract Defined
#白内障定义
## What is a cataract?
##什么是白内障？
A cataract is a clouding of the lens in the eye that affects vision. Most cataracts are related to aging. Cataracts are very common in older people. By age 80, more than half of all Americans either have a cataract or have had cataract surgery.
白内障是指眼球晶状体发生浑浊，从而影响视力。大多数白内障都和老龄化有关。白内障在老年人中极为常见。美国80岁的人群中，超过半数的人或者患有白内障或者动过白内障手术。

A cataract can occur in either or both eyes. It cannot spread from one eye to the other.
白内障可能单只眼睛患有，也可能两只眼睛同时患有，但是眼睛与眼睛之间是不会相互传染的。

## What is the lens?
##什么是晶状体？
The lens is a clear part of the eye that helps to focus light, or an image, on the retina. The retina is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye.
晶状体是眼球中的透明部分，作用是将光线或者图片聚焦到视网膜上，视网膜是位于眼球底部的感官组织。

In a normal eye, light passes through the transparent lens to the retina. Once it reaches the retina, light is changed into nerve signals that are sent to the brain.
正常情况下，光线穿过晶状体到达视网膜，然后被转化为神经信号传送至大脑。

The lens must be clear for the retina to receive a sharp image. If the lens is cloudy from a cataract, the image you see will be blurred.
只有透明清晰的晶状体才能形成清晰的图像。一旦晶状体发生混浊，就会影响视网膜成像，使人看不清东西。

## Are there other types of cataract?
## 有其他种类的白内障么？
Yes. Although most cataracts are related to aging, there are other types of cataract:
是的。尽管大多数的白内障都和老龄化有关，白内障确实有其他不同的种类。
1. **Secondary cataract**. Cataracts can form after surgery for other eye problems, such as glaucoma. Cataracts also can develop in people who have other health problems, such as diabetes. Cataracts are sometimes linked to steroid use.
**后发性白内障**。白内障手术后可能会伴随残留皮质及囊膜混浊引起的眼部疾病，如青光眼。其他健康问题也可能引发白内障，比如糖尿病。使用类固醇也可能会引发白内障。
2. **Traumatic cataract**. Cataracts can develop after an eye injury, sometimes years later.
**创伤性白内障**。眼睛受伤也可能引发白内障，有时受伤多年后会发病。
3. **Congenital cataract**. Some babies are born with cataracts or develop them in childhood, often in both eyes. These cataracts may be so small that they do not affect vision. If they do, the lenses may need to be removed.
**先天性白内障**。有些孩子一出生或者童年成长过程中就患有白内障，两只眼睛都有。但先天性白内障往往很小，不会影响视力。如果影响视力了就需要摘除晶状体。
4. **Radiation cataract**. Cataracts can develop after exposure to some types of radiation.
**辐射性白内障**。某些辐射也引发白内障。

# Causes and Risk Factors
#原因和危险因素
## What causes cataracts?
##白内障的病因
The lens lies behind the iris and the pupil. It works much like a camera lens. It focuses light onto the retina at the back of the eye, where an image is recorded. The lens also adjusts the eye’s focus, letting us see things clearly both up close and far away. The lens is made of mostly water and protein. The protein is arranged in a precise way that keeps the lens clear and lets light pass through it.
晶状体位于虹膜和瞳孔之间。它就像相机的镜头，将光线聚焦到视网膜上，形成图像。晶状体也会改变人眼的焦距，这样远景和近景都可以看得清了。晶状体大部分由水和水溶性蛋白组成。水溶性蛋白功能正常则瞳孔清澈，光线能够穿透。

But as we age, some of the protein may clump together and start to cloud a small area of the lens. This is a cataract. Over time, the cataract may grow larger and cloud more of the lens, making it harder to see.
但是伴随着年龄的增长，部分水溶性蛋白会黏在一起导致晶状体部分混浊，这就是白内障。日子久了，白内障会越长越大，晶状体也愈发混浊，导致很难看清。

Researchers suspect that there are several causes of cataract, such as smoking and diabetes. Or, it may be that the protein in the lens just changes from the wear and tear it takes over the years.
研究人员猜想白内障的诱因有很多，比如吸烟和糖尿病。或者，水溶性蛋白正在从磨损和撕裂恢复过来，只不过需要很多年才能完成这一动作。

## How can cataracts affect my vision?
##白内障如何影响视力？
Age-related cataracts can affect your vision in two ways:
老年性白内障通过两种形式影响人的视力：
1.Clumps of protein reduce the sharpness of the image reaching the retina.
发生黏合的水溶性蛋白降低了视网膜成像的清晰度。

The lens consists mostly of water and protein. When the protein clumps up, it clouds the lens and reduces the light that reaches the retina. The clouding may become severe enough to cause blurred vision. Most age-related cataracts develop from protein clumpings.
晶状体大部分由水和水溶性蛋白组成。发生黏合蛋白质使晶状体变得混浊，减少了到达视网膜的光线。混浊严重的情况下会导致成像模糊。大多数跟老年性白内障都和水溶性蛋白发生黏合有关。

When a cataract is small, the cloudiness affects only a small part of the lens. You may not notice any changes in your vision. Cataracts tend to “grow” slowly, so vision gets worse gradually. Over time, the cloudy area in the lens may get larger, and the cataract may increase in size. Seeing may become more difficult. Your vision may get duller or blurrier.
当白内障还小的时候，晶状体只有一小部分发生混浊。你可能不大感觉得到有什么变化。白内障往往长得很慢，因此视视力是慢慢的变差的。时间久了，发生混浊的部分变大，白内障变大。看东西会变得很吃力。你的视力会变得越来越模糊。

2.The clear lens slowly changes to a yellowish/brownish color, adding a brownish tint to vision.
正常透明的晶状体逐渐变成黄/棕色，给图像叠加了一层黄色色调。

As the clear lens slowly colors with age, your vision gradually may acquire a brownish shade. At first, the amount of tinting may be small and may not cause a vision problem. Over time, increased tinting may make it more difficult to read and perform other routine activities. This gradual change in the amount of tinting does not affect the sharpness of the image transmitted to the retina.
当晶状体随着年龄的增长慢慢变色，你的视力也会慢慢地增加一层棕色的色调。期初，色调可能很浅，不会影响视力。时间一长，色调加深，甚至影响阅读和其他日常的行为。色调的变化并不会影响视网膜成像的清晰度。

If you have advanced lens discoloration, you may not be able to identify blues and purples. You may be wearing what you believe to be a pair of black socks, only to find out from friends that you are wearing purple socks.
如果你有深度的晶状体褪色情况，你可能无法分辨蓝色和紫色。你可能认为自己穿着一双黑袜子，而你的朋友告诉你，你穿的其实是紫色的袜子。

## When are you most likely to have a cataract?
##什么时候最可能患上白内障？
The term “age-related” is a little misleading. You don’t have to be a senior citizen to get this type of cataract. In fact, people can have an age-related cataract in their 40s and 50s. But during middle age, most cataracts are small and do not affect vision. It is after age 60 that most cataracts steal vision.
“老年性”可能有一点点误导性。白内障患者不一定都是老年人。事实上，人在40到50岁之间可能会患上白内障。但是，中年人的白内障往往比较小，不会影响视力。大多数白内障都是在60岁之后影响人的视力的。

## Who is at risk for cataract?
##谁是白内障的危险人群？
The risk of cataract increases as you get older. Other risk factors for cataract include:
得白内障的风险伴随着年龄的增长而增长。其他的风险因子包括：
    - Certain diseases such as diabetes.
    诸如糖尿病之类的疾病
    - Personal behavior such as smoking and alcohol use.
    个人行为如抽烟喝酒。
    - The environment such as prolonged exposure to sunlight.
    环境因素，如长时间暴露在日光下。
    
## What can I do to protect my vision?
##如何保护视力？
Wearing sunglasses and a hat with a brim to block ultraviolet sunlight may help to delay cataract. If you smoke, stop. Researchers also believe good nutrition can help reduce the risk of age-related cataract. They recommend eating green leafy vegetables, fruit, and other foods with antioxidants.
佩戴防紫外线的太阳眼镜可能会帮助减缓白内障长大。如果你抽烟，可以戒了。研究人员同样相信好的营养可以帮助降低患老年性白内障的风险。他们建议多吃绿叶蔬菜、水果和其他含抗氧化剂的食物。

If you are age 60 or older, you should have a comprehensive dilated eye exam at least once every two years. In addition to cataract, your eye care professional can check for signs of age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and other vision disorders. Early treatment for many eye diseases may save your sight.
如果你已经60岁或者60岁以上了，你至少应该每两年做一次全面的散瞳检查。除了白内障，你的眼科护理医生还会为你检测是否有患老年性黄斑病变、青光眼和其他视力疾病的迹象。及早的治疗可以避免你因为就医不及时而致盲。

# Symptoms and Detection
# 症状和检测
## What are the symptoms of a cataract?
##白内障有什么症状？
The most common symptoms of a cataract are:
最常见的白内障症状是：
		- Cloudy or blurry vision.
    - 视力模糊。
		- Colors seem faded.
    — 颜色出现褪色。
		- Glare. Headlights, lamps, or sunlight may appear too bright. A halo may appear around lights.
    - 炫光。灯或者阳光显得过于明亮，视物出现光圈。
		- Poor night vision.
    - 夜视力很差。
		- Double vision or multiple images in one eye. (This symptom may clear as the cataract gets larger.)
    - 单眼出现重影。（这一症状将在白内障长大后变得更加明显。）
		- Frequent prescription changes in your eyeglasses or contact lenses.
    - 经常更换眼镜或者隐形眼镜
		- These symptoms also can be a sign of other eye problems. If you have any of these symptoms, check with your eye care professional.
    - 这些症状也可能是患有其他眼科疾病的迹象。如果有上述任何症状，记得去看眼科护理医生。

## How is a cataract detected?
## 如何检查是否患有白内障？
Cataract is detected through a comprehensive eye exam that includes:
白内障的检查需要通过全面的眼部检查，包括：
1.**Visual acuity test**. This eye chart test measures how well you see at various distances.
1.**视力测试**。视力测试衡量你在不同距离看物的清晰度。
2.**Dilated eye exam**. Drops are placed in your eyes to widen, or dilate, the pupils. Your eye care professional uses a special magnifying lens to examine your retina and optic nerve for signs of damage and other eye problems. After the exam, your close-up vision may remain blurred for several hours.
2.**散瞳检查**。医生将药水滴入你的眼中，使瞳孔放大。医生使用一种特殊的放大镜来检查你的视网膜和感光神经是否有损伤，是否有其他眼科疾病。检查后，还有几小时视物模糊。
3.**Tonometry**. An instrument measures the pressure inside the eye. Numbing drops may be applied to your eye for this test.
3.**眼压计**。一种测量眼内部压力的仪器，需要事先滴麻醉滴眼液。
Your eye care professional also may do other tests to learn more about the structure and health of your eye.
你的眼科护理医生也会对你的眼部结构和健康做一些检查。
# Treatment
# 治疗
## How is a cataract treated?
## 如何治疗白内障？
The symptoms of early cataract may be improved with new eyeglasses, brighter lighting, anti-glare sunglasses, or magnifying lenses. If these measures do not help, surgery is the only effective treatment. Surgery involves removing the cloudy lens and replacing it with an artificial lens.
白内障的早起症状可以通过更换（brighter lighting）防眩光眼镜，或者（放大镜片）。如果这些办法不能奏效，只能通过手术治疗了。手术包括移除混浊的晶状体，代之以人工的晶状体。

A cataract needs to be removed only when vision loss interferes with your everyday activities, such as driving, reading, or watching TV. You and your eye care professional can make this decision together. Once you understand the benefits and risks of surgery, you can make an informed decision about whether cataract surgery is right for you. In most cases, delaying cataract surgery will not cause long-term damage to your eye or make the surgery more difficult. You do not have to rush into surgery.
只有当白内障影响到诸如开车、阅读或者看电视这些日常行为时才有必要进行手术。你和你的眼科护理医生可以一起做决定。清楚并权衡了手术的利弊和风险，你才能做出适合自己的决定。大多数情况下，延误手术将对你的眼睛造成长期的伤害或者使得手术更为艰难。不过你也不必急着手术。

Sometimes a cataract should be removed even if it does not cause problems with your vision. For example, a cataract should be removed if it prevents examination or treatment of another eye problem, such as age-related macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy. If your eye care professional finds a cataract, you may not need cataract surgery for several years. In fact, you might never need cataract surgery. By having your vision tested regularly, you and your eye care professional can discuss if and when you might need treatment.
有时，在尚未影响视力的情况下，也需要做白内障移除。比如，白内障影响到其他诸如老年性黄斑病变或糖尿病视网膜病变等眼科疾病的检查和治疗时。如果你的眼科医生说你患了白内障，你可能头几年都不需要做手术。事实上，你可能永远都不需要做手术。你可以定期检查视力，和你的医生商量商量是否需要治疗，什么时候治疗合适。

If you choose surgery, your eye care professional may refer you to a specialist to remove the cataract.
如果你选择做手术，你的医生引荐你相应的专家。

If you have cataracts in both eyes that require surgery, the surgery will be performed on each eye at separate times, usually four to eight weeks apart.
如果你的左右眼都需要手术，可以分开两次做，通常前后间隔4到8周。

Many people who need cataract surgery also have other eye conditions, such as age-related macular degeneration or glaucoma. If you have other eye conditions in addition to cataract, talk with your doctor. Learn about the risks, benefits, alternatives, and expected results of cataract surgery.
很多需要进行白内障移除手术的患者可能会同时患有其他眼科疾病，如老年性黄斑病变或者青光眼。如果患有其他眼科疾病，请告知你的医生。了解手术的风险、备选方案、预期的效果。

## What are the different types of cataract surgery?
## 有哪些不同类型的白内障手术？
There are two types of cataract surgery. Your doctor can explain the differences and help determine which is better for you:
白内障手术分两种，医生会解释两者的不同并帮你决定哪一种更适合你：
1.**Phacoemulsification**, or**phaco**. A small incision is made on the side of the cornea, the clear, dome-shaped surface that covers the front of the eye. Your doctor inserts a tiny probe into the eye. This device emits ultrasound waves that soften and break up the lens so that it can be removed by suction. Most cataract surgery today is done by phacoemulsification, also called “small incision cataract surgery.”
白内障超声乳化术。
2.**Extracapsular surgery**. Your doctor makes a longer incision on the side of the cornea and removes the cloudy core of the lens in one piece. The rest of the lens is removed by suction.
After the natural lens has been removed, it often is replaced by an artificial lens, called an intraocular lens (IOL). An IOL is a clear, plastic lens that requires no care and becomes a permanent part of your eye. Light is focused clearly by the IOL onto the retina, improving your vision. You will not feel or see the new lens.

Some people cannot have an IOL. They may have another eye disease or have problems during surgery. For these patients, a soft contact lens, or glasses that provide high magnification, may be suggested.


## What are the risks of cataract surgery?
As with any surgery, cataract surgery poses risks, such as infection and bleeding. Before cataract surgery, your doctor may ask you to temporarily stop taking certain medications that increase the risk of bleeding during surgery. After surgery, you must keep your eye clean, wash your hands before touching your eye, and use the prescribed medications to help minimize the risk of infection. Serious infection can result in loss of vision.

Cataract surgery slightly increases your risk of retinal detachment. Other eye disorders, such as high myopia (nearsightedness), can further increase your risk of retinal detachment after cataract surgery. One sign of a retinal detachment is a sudden increase in flashes or floaters. Floaters are little “cobwebs” or specks that seem to float about in your field of vision. If you notice a sudden increase in floaters or flashes, see an eye care professional immediately. A retinal detachment is a medical emergency. If necessary, go to an emergency service or hospital. Your eye must be examined by an eye surgeon as soon as possible. A retinal detachment causes no pain. Early treatment for retinal detachment often can prevent permanent loss of vision. The sooner you get treatment, the more likely you will regain good vision. Even if you are treated promptly, some vision may be lost.

Talk to your eye care professional about these risks. Make sure cataract surgery is right for you.


## Is cataract surgery effective?
Cataract removal is one of the most common operations performed in the United States. It also is one of the safest and most effective types of surgery. In about 90 percent of cases, people who have cataract surgery have better vision afterward.


## What happens before surgery?
A week or two before surgery, your doctor will do some tests. These tests may include measuring the curve of the cornea and the size and shape of your eye. This information helps your doctor choose the right type of IOL.

You may be asked not to eat or drink anything 12 hours before your surgery.


## What happens during surgery?
At the hospital or eye clinic, drops will be put into your eye to dilate the pupil. The area around your eye will be washed and cleansed.

The operation usually lasts less than one hour and is almost painless. Many people choose to stay awake during surgery. Others may need to be put to sleep for a short time.

If you are awake, you will have an anesthetic to numb the nerves in and around your eye.

After the operation, a patch may be placed over your eye. You will rest for a while. Your medical team will watch for any problems, such as bleeding. Most people who have cataract surgery can go home the same day. You will need someone to drive you home.


## What happens after surgery?
Itching and mild discomfort are normal after cataract surgery. Some fluid discharge is also common. Your eye may be sensitive to light and touch. If you have discomfort, your doctor can suggest treatment. After one or two days, moderate discomfort should disappear.

For a few days after surgery, your doctor may ask you to use eyedrops to help healing and decrease the risk of infection. Ask your doctor about how to use your eyedrops, how often to use them, and what effects they can have. You will need to wear an eye shield or eyeglasses to help protect your eye. Avoid rubbing or pressing on your eye.

When you are home, try not to bend from the waist to pick up objects on the floor. Do not lift any heavy objects. You can walk, climb stairs, and do light household chores.

In most cases, healing will be complete within eight weeks. Your doctor will schedule exams to check on your progress.


## Can problems develop after surgery?
Problems after surgery are rare, but they can occur. These problems can include infection, bleeding, inflammation (pain, redness, swelling), loss of vision, double vision, and high or low eye pressure. With prompt medical attention, these problems can usually be treated successfully.

Sometimes the eye tissue that encloses the IOL becomes cloudy and may blur your vision. This condition is called an after-cataract. An after-cataract can develop months or years after cataract surgery.

An after-cataract is treated with a laser. Your doctor uses a laser to make a tiny hole in the eye tissue behind the lens to let light pass through. This outpatient procedure is called a YAG laser capsulotomy. It is painless and rarely results in increased eye pressure or other eye problems. As a precaution, your doctor may give you eyedrops to lower your eye pressure before or after the procedure.


## When will my vision be normal again?
You can return quickly to many everyday activities, but your vision may be blurry. The healing eye needs time to adjust so that it can focus properly with the other eye, especially if the other eye has a cataract. Ask your doctor when you can resume driving.

If you received an IOL, you may notice that colors are very bright. The IOL is clear, unlike your natural lens that may have had a yellowish/brownish tint. Within a few months after receiving an IOL, you will become used to improved color vision. Also, when your eye heals, you may need new glasses or contact lenses.


## What can I do if I already have lost some vision from cataract?
If you have lost some sight from cataract or cataract surgery, ask your eye care professional about low vision services and devices that may help you make the most of your remaining vision. Ask for a referral to a specialist in low vision. Many community organizations and agencies offer information about low vision counseling, training, and other special services for people with visual impairments. A nearby school of medicine or optometry may provide low vision services.

# Current Research

## What research is being done?
The National Eye Institute is conducting and supporting a number of studies focusing on factors associated with the development of age-related cataract. These studies include:

The effect of sunlight exposure, which may be associated with an increased risk of cataract.
Vitamin supplements, which have shown varying results in delaying the progression of cataract.
Genetic studies, which show promise for better understanding cataract development.
