#Why You Must Lie On Job Interviews And What You Must Lie About
##面试必须说谎的原因以及必须说的谎

All of the characteristics HR looks for in a job candidate are the polar opposite of what enlightened leaders seek in new talent. While HR is tediously focused on making certain that candidates "play well in the sandbox," strong managers want those who don't venture near the proverbial box. Which creates a conundrum and a paradox:to get to the latter you need to lie to the former. As well you should. Why be held hostage to a broken system?
HR看重的应聘者特质和有眼光的领导需要的特质有着天壤之别。HR一味得关注“良好的团队合作精神”，领导需要的却是不走寻常路。这就带来了一个难题和悖论：要想一面到底就必须对HR说谎。你也应该说谎，我们没必要跟败坏的系统作对。

Case in point: the HR person will likely ask you if you work well with others? Well, many of the smartest and most innovative people on the planet simply don't. Not that they are trouble makers or in any way venal but they simply prefer to work alone, creating marvels of software, mathematical formulas or extraordinary feats of creativity. But can they tell HR:
举个例子来说：HR很有可能会问你的团队合作情况。很多高智商和有想法的人往往不会和人合作得太愉快。并不是因为他们想惹麻烦或者独享劳动成果，他们只是喜欢独自工作，私人的空间激发他们创造超赞的软件，数学程式或者极具创意的成果。但是他们能对HR说：

"No. I don't really like working with others. I guess you can say I do my best work by myself. My professors at MIT used to call me a 'loner.'"
“不，我不喜欢和别人合作。我想我独自一人工作时表现最好。我在MIT时，我的导师叫我独行侠。”

HR's universal reaction to this honest response would be "Next." Einstein and Newton would have failed their test.
对这种诚实的回答，HR的普遍反应是“下一位。”如果爱因斯坦和牛顿去面试，应该会通不过。

For years, my firm worked with a hedge fund that invests capital based on quantitative strategies, developed by their team of math and physics brainiacs. None even pretend to enjoy the social aspects of the work environment. For them, it is all about hibernation, concentration and introspection. They never stepped into a a sandbox as kids and they aren't about to start now.
多年来，我的公司基于量化的工具管理用于投资的对冲基金。这些工具是由一支在数学和物理方面极具造诣的团队开发的。他们没有一人会假装自己喜欢工作环境中的任何社交。对他们来说，他们眼里只有蛰伏、专注和自省。他们从未融入团队，他们也不打算这样做。

Over the course of an intense year when we examined and adjusted many of the practices of the fund, management came to recognize that the caliber of the candidates coming to them for second-stage interviews was way down below the quality hierarchy. On closer examination, we discovered the HR filter was turning the best and the brightest away before they could be seen by senior fund managers -- all geeks and loners in their own right. The solution was simple: HR was limited to managing the fund's employee benefits and policies and completely removed from the hiring process.
经过紧张的一年，当我们检查和调整了公司的运作，但是管理层在第二阶段的面试时发现应聘者的才智远比要求的素质等级低。经过仔细的检查，我们发现在最好的人才在见到高级管理层之前早就被HR筛除了。所有的极客和独行侠都这么错失了机会。解决方法很简单：要知道HR的职能只局限于管理公司的员工福利和政策以及初步筛选。

Another HR question that demands a lie goes like this:
另一个HR会问而你必须说谎的问题是：

"So tell me why you want to work for our company."
“谈一谈为什么你想加入我们公司。”

In many cases, the honest answer would be:
很多情况下，诚实的回答是：

"I think this is the best place to make a fortune before I'm 35. I really want a chunk of those stock options."
”我觉得这是我35岁之前赚大钱最好的去处。我真的很想要股票和期权。”

But to the HR paint-by-numbers gang, that would lead to a fast dismissal out the fire exit. To get to the next-stage interview you have to lie, waxing poetic about the company's innovative culture or lionizing it's irreverent founder (who, by the way, is eager to have brilliant wealth-seeking hot shots on the team).
但对于墨守成规的HR，你很可能就被刷了。为了进入下一轮面试，你必须说谎，对公司的创新型文化润润色或者吹捧一下创始人（他如何在团队中脱颖而出，创造了巨大的财富）。

The old adage "Just be yourself," is a fool's game when it comes to the hiring process. Instead, at the outset, you need to be what HR wants you to be. And in most cases, you need to (and very well should) lie to win a pass to see the real players in the company. The ones with a 180 degree different (from HR) perspective on life/business/success and how to get what you want in your career.
招聘时，愚蠢的人才会照古话说的“展现真我”。相反，你需要成为HR喜欢的那种人。大多数情况下，如果你对生活/工作/成功的看法和HR南辕北辙，你需要（而且很有必要）通过说谎来进入下轮面试。

Look, I don't believe in making lying a way of life--in fact, I appreciate blunt and honest people and think of myself in this way. But when a system is stacked against the truth, dance around it.
我并不认同将说谎作为一种生活方式---事实上，我欣赏直率和诚实的人，我自己也朝着这方面发展。但是当一个体系有悖于事实得运转时，请配合它。
